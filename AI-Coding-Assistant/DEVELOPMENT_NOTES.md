## Step-by-Step System Analysis

### 1. System Overview

Continue.dev is an open-source AI coding assistant that integrates with IDEs and provides advanced coding assistance using large language models. The system is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for extensibility.

At a high level, the system consists of:
