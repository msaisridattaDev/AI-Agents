   - Agent state (current task, progress)
   - Tool execution state (running tools, results)
   - Context state (retrieved snippets, prioritization)
   - Editor state (open files, selections)

3. **Communication Patterns**
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Message passing between components
   - Asynchronous processing with Promises/async-await
   - Streaming responses for real-time feedback

   - Custom context providers with unified API
   - Custom UI components for different IDE environments
   - Slash commands for custom functionality

5. **Data Flow**
   - User input → Context building → LLM query → Tool execution → Response processing → UI rendering
   - Bidirectional communication between IDE and core engine
   - Streaming data from LLM to UI for real-time feedback
   - Context prioritization and selection before LLM queries

6. **Configuration System**
   - YAML/JSON configuration files
   - Environment variable support
   - User settings integration
   - Dynamic configuration loading
   - Defaults with override capabilities
