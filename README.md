# AI Agents: From Simple to Sophisticated

This repository contains implementations of AI agents at different levels of sophistication, from basic reinforcement learning agents to production-grade AI coding assistants. The repository is organized into separate projects, each demonstrating different aspects of AI agent technology.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into separate projects, each with its own directory:

### 1. Simple-AI-Agent

A basic implementation of an autonomous AI agent that can navigate a grid environment to reach a goal. This project demonstrates fundamental principles of AI agents using reinforcement learning.

Key features:
- Autonomous operation without human intervention
- Goal-directed behavior
- Path planning using A* algorithm
- Environmental mapping and state tracking
- Decision-making with transparency

### 2. AI-Coding-Assistant

A production-grade AI coding assistant built on large language models with specialized tools for software development. This project aims to create a sophisticated AI agent specifically designed for coding tasks.

Key features:
- Code understanding and generation
- Context-aware assistance
- Tool integration for development workflows
- Autonomous agent capabilities
- Memory systems for effective assistance

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions for setup and usage. Navigate to the project you're interested in to learn more:

- [Simple AI Agent](./Simple-AI-Agent/README.md)
- [AI Coding Assistant](./AI-Coding-Assistant/README.md)

## Project Comparison

This repository demonstrates the evolution of AI agent technology through two distinct implementations:

1. **Simple-AI-Agent**: A basic reinforcement learning agent with limited capabilities but demonstrating fundamental principles of autonomy and goal-directed behavior.

2. **AI-Coding-Assistant**: A sophisticated LLM-based agent with advanced capabilities for code understanding, generation, and autonomous operation within software development workflows.

By exploring both projects, you can understand the significant differences in complexity, capabilities, and architecture between simple and advanced AI agents.
