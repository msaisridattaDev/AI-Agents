# Simple AI Agent

This directory contains a basic implementation of an AI agent using reinforcement learning techniques. It serves as an educational example of how to build simple autonomous agents.

## Overview

The Simple AI Agent is a basic implementation that demonstrates:
- Reinforcement learning principles
- Environment interaction
- Agent decision-making
- Training and evaluation

## Components

- `agent.py`: Basic agent implementation
- `enhanced_agent.py`: Improved agent with additional capabilities
- `environment.py`: Simulation environment for the agent
- `train_agent.py`: Training script for the agent
- `autonomous_agent.py`: More advanced autonomous agent implementation
- `web_interface.py`: Web UI for interacting with the agent
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the agent

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Agent

```bash
python main.py
```

### Training the Agent

```bash
python train_agent.py
```

## Limitations

This is a simple educational implementation and has several limitations:
- Limited perception capabilities
- Narrow intelligence (solves only navigation problems)
- Predetermined capabilities
- No true learning beyond what's explicitly programmed

## Next Steps

For a more advanced AI agent implementation, see the AI-Coding-Assistant directory in the parent folder, which implements a production-grade AI coding assistant based on large language models.
